# NxN-Sudoku
NxN Sudoku checker for correct completions in Python

Change the 'board' variable to equal the Sudoku puzzle you had attempted by referencing any of the examples.
The console will tell you if the puzzle has been correctly or incorrectly completed, along with which errors have been made.
If an impossible puzzle size (ex: 2x2,3x3,5x5) has been entered, the console will declare it as invalid.
Yes, it does test for a 1x1 sized puzzle.

I've always enjoyed completing these puzzles and would like to use this work as part of a containerized Sudoku solver.
I want this to incorporate all of advanced logic techniques before rushing to 'guess and check' solving.

Thank you for checking out my code and please let me know if you have any python code positions available remotely.
